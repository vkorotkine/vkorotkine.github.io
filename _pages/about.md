My research lies under the umbrella of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), where the robot
seeks to answer the following questions: 1) Where am I? and 2) What does the environment look like?

I am particularly interested in situations where there is inherent ambiguity in the environment, such as the case of unknown data associations, where the robot does not know which landmark a measurement came from.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
